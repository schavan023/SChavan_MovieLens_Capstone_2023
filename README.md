# SChavan_MovieLens_Capstone_2023
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting user ratings (ranging from 0.5 to 5 stars) based on the provided subset of data (specifically the edx dataset provided by the staff). The algorithm's performance will be evaluated in predicting movie ratings within a given validation set.

Evaluation Metric
The primary metric for assessing the algorithm's performance is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). RMSE is a widely used measure for quantifying the differences between predicted values generated by a model and the actual observed values. In the context of this project, a lower RMSE indicates higher accuracy. This metric allows for the comparison of forecasting errors across different models for a specific dataset.

Sensitivity to Outliers
It is crucial to note that RMSE is particularly sensitive to outliers. The impact of each error on the overall RMSE is proportional to the squared error's magnitude. Consequently, larger errors carry a disproportionately greater weight in influencing the RMSE. Careful consideration of outliers is essential for accurate model evaluation.
